# Sound Healing MANCOVA Analysis

This repository contains the Python-based statistical analysis conducted as part of an academic study on the effects of sound healing interventions. Specifically, this project applies a Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANCOVA) to assess outcomes related to Anxiety, Spirituality, and Stress across different conditions.

## 📌 Objective

To demonstrate how multivariate statistical techniques like MANCOVA can be applied using Python to analyze experimental data from behavioral and psychological studies.

This code is tailored for peer-reviewed research purposes and reflects a precise, structured approach to multivariate inference.

## 📂 Contents

- `main.py` – Clean, console-based Python script that performs MANCOVA and displays results in a formatted layout.
- `anonymized_data.xlsx` – Example dataset with all personally identifiable information removed. Subjects are labeled as Name 1 to Name 30.
- `output.PNG` – A screenshot of the terminal output generated by the script.

## 🔬 Methodology

- **Statistical Test:** MANCOVA using `statsmodels`
- **Variables Analyzed:**
  - Dependent Variables: Anxiety, Spirituality, Stress
  - Independent Variable: Type of Test (Pre/Post)
- **Libraries Used:** `pandas`, `statsmodels`
